# FARS

The goal of FARS is to provide a small set of functions that allow you to read in and analyze data
from the US National Highway Traffic Safety's Fatality Analysis Reporting System. The functions 
included in this package allow you to create filenames, read in data, create annual summaries, 
and plot maps of fatal accidents by state. This package was created as part of the final project 
in the Building R Packages course for the Mastering Software Development in R specialization on Coursera.
